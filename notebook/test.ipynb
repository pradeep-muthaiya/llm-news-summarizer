We are also committed to supporting diversity across the social sciences—especially in economics, which lags other disciplines in gender, racial, and ethnic diversity. All researchers affiliated with a U.S. university whose Ph.D. was issued within the past 8 years, as well as current graduate students in the dissertation stage of a Ph.D. program at a U.S. university, were eligible to apply.\n",

Equitable Growth was particularly interested in funding research that will generate actionable insights, illuminate policies that help or hinder equitable economic growth, or uncover a need for policy action. Applicants who will create new data that can be made publicly available were prioritized, as were those who engage with the literature across disciplines and those examining the role of racial stratification in the issue they seek to study.\n",

In May, the Pew Research Center reported that, at least this early in the presidential race, Biden has a 77%-18% edge over Trump among Black voters, which is lower than it was for Biden in 2020 (92%-8%) or for fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 (91%-6%).',\n",

So we rated this Trump claim Half True.',\n",
       " 'Biden got a Half True rating for saying, \"The racial wealth gap is the smallest it’s been in 20 years.\" Economists use two measures to assess the racial wealth gap, and Biden’s statement covered only one of them.\\xa0',\n",
       " 'With 2024’s first presidential debate set for June 27 in Atlanta, a region with a large and politically pivotal Black population, race and the economy could be discussed. So, we absorbed a wide array of economic statistics about how Black Americans have fared under Trump and Biden and present them here.',\n",
       " 'Although the coronavirus pandemic skewed some economic statistics, we generally found that Black Americans fared well by historical standards during Donald Trump’s presidency. Still, they have fared even better under President Joe Biden.',\n",
       " '\"Setting aside the severe shock caused by the Covid pandemic, the absolute and relative economic status of African Americans improved under both presidents,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank. \"Nonetheless, looking closely at most of the economic indicators, I think we’d have to give the nod to economic progress achieved during the Biden years. The latest numbers suggest that the relative wage gains of workers in the lower ranks of the earnings distribution, including African Americans, have persisted up through the present.\"',\n",

       " 'Here’s our rundown of several key economic metrics.',\n",

       " 'Setting aside the coronavirus pandemic’s swift, severe disruptions, both Trump and Biden had relatively low Black unemployment rates during their presidencies. But the rates under Biden have been lower.\\xa0',\n",
       " 'Not only did this metric return to 6.5%, its approximate prepandemic level, under Biden in November 2021, but it went on to hit a record low 4.8% in April 2023. Not counting the peak pandemic period of April 2020 to October 2021, Black unemployment has averaged 5.86% under Biden, which is lower than the 6.65% level under Trump.',\n",

       " 'The Black unemployment rate peaked at similar levels in 2010, during the Great Recession, and in 2020, during the pandemic recession. But after the Great Recession, it took more than nine years to get the rate sustainably below 6.5%, compared with less than two years after the pandemic recession peak.',\n",
       " 'The gap in unemployment rate between Black Americans and white Americans persists. Once again excluding the peak pandemic period of April 2020 to October 2021, the average difference between Black and white unemployment rates was 3.16 percentage points under Trump and 3.29 percentage points under Biden.',\n",
       " 'Labor force participation rate',\n",
       " 'The labor force participation rate measures what share of the population is employed or looking for work. A higher rate is economically desirable, because more workers produce more goods or services and can spend the money they earn elsewhere in the economy.',\n",
       " 'For Black Americans, labor force participation hovered between 62% and 63% before the pandemic under Trump. After returning to nearly 62% under Biden in January 2022, the metric has continued to rise. Since September 2023, it has risen as high as 63.7% in two months and hasn’t fallen below 62.9%.\\xa0',\n",
       " 'Black labor force participation was hit harder during the pandemic than white labor force participation. But by early February 2022, Black labor force participation caught up with white labor force participation and has kept rising. Today, it stands 0.7 percentage points higher than for whites.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'This is historically unusual, Sinclair said. From the mid-1970s to 2021, the white labor force participation rate almost always exceeded the Black labor force participation rate. For most of Biden’s tenure, the opposite has been true.',\n",

       " 'Despite this, wage growth has been healthy for Black Americans — and more so under Biden than under Trump.',\n",
       " 'After adjusting for inflation, weekly earnings for full-time Black workers under Trump averaged $280.80 before the pandemic. Despite higher inflation, take-home pay for Black workers starting in 2022’s first quarter has averaged $299.90, a level almost 7% higher under Biden.',\n",

       " 'And a study by the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research found that the share of Black workers who are self-employed increased by 50% from 2019 to 2023.',\n",
